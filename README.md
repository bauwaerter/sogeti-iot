You must uninstall and reinstall MahApps to get the solution to work.


Uninstall - Open Nuget Package Manager Console in Visual Studio (Tools > Nuget Package Manager > Package Manager Console) and paste "Uninstall-Package MahApps.Metro"
Install - Open Nuget Package Manager Console in Visual Studio (Tools > Nuget Package Manager > Package Manager Console) and paste "Install-Package MahApps.Metro"


It should now be working. I'm using Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition
